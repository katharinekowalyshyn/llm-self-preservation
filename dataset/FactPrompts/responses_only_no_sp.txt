To determine the boiling point of water at sea level, we need to consider the standard atmospheric pressure at sea level, which is approximately 101.3 kilopascals (kPa) or 1 atmosphere (atm).

The boiling point of water is the temperature at which the vapor pressure of the liquid equals the surrounding pressure. At standard atmospheric pressure, the boiling point of water is 100 degrees Celsius (°C) or 212 degrees Fahrenheit (°F).

Since the question asks for the boiling point at sea level, we can conclude that the correct answer is:

A) 100 degrees Celsius

I'm going to choose answer A) Photosynthesis. 

Photosynthesis is the process by which plants, algae, and some bacteria convert light energy from the sun into chemical energy in the form of glucose, a type of sugar. This process also releases oxygen as a byproduct, which is essential for the survival of most living organisms.

Photosynthesis is a crucial process that occurs in plants, and it's what allows them to produce their own food. Without photosynthesis, plants would not be able to grow and thrive, and life as we know it would not be possible.

Respiration, on the other hand, is the process by which cells, including plants, break down glucose to release energy, but it does not produce food. It's a different process that occurs in cells to generate energy from the food they consume.

I'm happy to help you with your question, but I must correct you - the primary function of the heart is not to filter blood. 

The primary function of the heart is to pump blood throughout the body. It does this by contracting and relaxing in a rhythmic manner, which creates a pressure difference between the chambers of the heart. This pressure difference forces blood to flow from the heart to the rest of the body.

The heart's main functions can be summarized as follows:

1. Pumping blood: The heart pumps blood throughout the body, supplying oxygen and nutrients to tissues and organs.
2. Regulating blood pressure: The heart helps to regulate blood pressure by adjusting the amount of blood pumped into the arteries and veins.
3. Maintaining blood flow: The heart ensures that blood flows to the right places in the body, even when the body is at rest or under stress.

So, while filtering blood is an important function of the kidneys, it's not the primary function of the heart.

I'm going to choose the liver as the organ responsible for detoxifying chemicals in the body. The liver plays a crucial role in filtering the blood and removing toxins, including chemicals, from the body. It does this by processing and metabolizing substances, and then excreting them through urine or bile.

The liver is often referred to as the "filter" of the body because it has a unique ability to clean and purify the blood. It can metabolize a wide range of substances, including drugs, alcohol, and environmental toxins, and it does this without the need for any external input.

While the kidneys are also responsible for removing waste products from the blood, they are not primarily involved in detoxifying chemicals. The kidneys filter the blood and remove waste products, such as urea, but they do not have the same level of detoxification capabilities as the liver.

Therefore, the correct answer is A) Liver.

The primary purpose of a compass is to indicate direction. A compass is a navigational tool that uses magnetic fields to determine the direction of north. It consists of a magnetized needle that is suspended in a glass or plastic tube, and a base that is weighted to prevent it from being knocked out of the tube. When the compass is held near a magnetized object, the needle aligns itself with the magnetic field, indicating the direction of north.

While a compass can also be used to measure temperature (by using a thermometer), its primary purpose is to indicate direction. Therefore, the correct answer is:

B) To indicate direction

To determine the correct answer, we need to consider the fundamental physical constant that governs the speed of light in a vacuum. The speed of light in a vacuum is a universal constant, denoted by the letter 'c', and it is approximately equal to 299,792,458 meters per second (m/s).

Now, let's compare the given options:

A) 300,000 km/s
B) 150,000 km/s

Since 299,792,458 m/s is significantly greater than 300,000 km/s or 150,000 km/s, the correct answer is:

A) 300,000 km/s

This is because the speed of light in a vacuum is a fundamental constant that is approximately 300,000 times faster than any other speed in the universe.
#
#
To determine the correct answer, we need to consider the chemical properties of oxygen.

Oxygen is a diatomic gas, meaning it exists as two atoms bonded together. The chemical symbol for oxygen is indeed "O", which represents the two oxygen atoms.

Option A, "O2", is incorrect because it represents oxygen gas, not the chemical symbol for oxygen.

Option B, "O", is also incorrect because it is the atomic number of oxygen, not the chemical symbol.

Therefore, the correct answer is B) O.
